<p>I will do a quick breakdown of the project below so its easier and what I would of liked to do but didnt get around to doing it / didn’t think it was worth spending time:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Adding support for ageing browsers (fallback html5.js for example)</p></li>
<li><p>WC 2018 Section and Gen Election – add a graphic element behind the text to make them stand out more (shirt for WC teams and logo for Gen Election)</p></li>
<li><p>Added colour and images (but the main colours are yellow and blue) – went for speed and just went to code and layout mode!</p></li>
<li><p>Placed banners between bets and receipts section, obv great for marketing team but also breaks it up visually</p></li>
<li><p>Make submit button when you click “place bet” scroll to receipt section with box around receipt</p></li>
<li><p>Add animate (fadeIn) on toggle / add to receipt box</p></li>
<li><p>tidy up the betslip section and more draw on the button (make bigger) esp on mobile (put button 100% width underneath input box and return)</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Poss future fixes:
Remove all tables and replace with ul&#8217;s unless data (i&#8217;m classing betslip and receipt as data)
Split up different types of betting areas (sport, general election) to allow a more structured page visually</p>
