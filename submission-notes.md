I will do a quick breakdown of the project below so its easier and what I would of liked to do but didnt get around to doing it / didn’t think it was worth spending time:

- Adding support for ageing browsers (fallback html5.js for example)

- WC 2018 Section and Gen Election – add a graphic element behind the text to make them stand out more (shirt for WC teams and logo for Gen Election)

- Added colour and images (but the main colours are yellow and blue) – went for speed and just went to code and layout mode!

- Placed banners between bets and receipts section, obv great for marketing team but also breaks it up visually

- Make submit button when you click “place bet” scroll to receipt section with box around receipt

- Add animate (fadeIn) on toggle / add to receipt box

- tidy up the betslip section and more draw on the button (make bigger) esp on mobile (put button 100% width underneath input box and return)

----

Poss future fixes:
Remove all tables and replace with ul's unless data (i'm classing betslip and receipt as data)
Split up different types of betting areas (sport, general election) to allow a more structured page visually
